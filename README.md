# MinCutMaxFlow
Final project-
a learning tool for students to understand the algorithms of finding the maximum flow in flow network, and the correlation of the maximum flow with the minimum cut of the network.
The application lets the users to draw their own flow network and to choose which algorithm they want to implement: Edomonds-Karp, Dinitz, Push-Relabel. The users can run forward the algorithm, and have also the options to pause and run backward - in order to undersand it better.
